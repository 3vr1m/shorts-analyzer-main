# 🎉 Shorts Analyzer Access Restored!

**Date**: August 13, 2025
**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL

## 🚀 Quick Fix Applied

Your shorts-analyzer (Shorts Analyzer) is now accessible again through the system Nginx configuration.

### ✅ Access URLs:
- **Main Application**: https://keywordalchemist.com/shorts/
- **API Health Check**: https://keywordalchemist.com/shorts/api/health
- **Direct Access** (still works): http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000

### ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ Main shorts-analyzer application loads correctly
- ✅ Database (PostgreSQL) running healthy on port 5432
- ✅ Cache (Redis) running healthy on port 6379  
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Next.js routing working through reverse proxy
- ✅ Static assets served correctly
- ✅ SSL certificates working for both applications

### ✅ Both Applications Running:
- **Keyword Alchemist**: https://keywordalchemist.com (main site)
- **Shorts Analyzer**: https://keywordalchemist.com/shorts/ (subdirectory)

## 🔧 What Was Done:

1. **Updated Nginx Configuration**: Modified `/etc/nginx/sites-available/keywordalchemist.com`
2. **Added Subdirectory Routing**: Shorts-analyzer accessible at `/shorts/` path
3. **Preserved SSL**: Both applications use the same SSL certificate
4. **API Routing**: Separate API paths for each application:
   - Keyword Alchemist API: `/api/`  
   - Shorts Analyzer API: `/shorts/api/`

## 📁 Current File Structure:
```
/root/shorts-analyzer/          # Application files
/opt/keyword-alchemist/         # Other application
/etc/nginx/sites-available/     # Nginx configurations
```

## 🔮 Future Plan (Phase 2):
- Move shorts-analyzer to `/opt/shorts-analyzer`
- Implement port standardization (4001-4004 for shorts-analyzer)
- Remove individual project Nginx containers
- Better organization and separation

## 📊 Container Status:
```bash
# Check all containers
docker ps | grep shorts
docker ps | grep keyword

# Check health
curl https://keywordalchemist.com/shorts/api/health
curl https://keywordalchemist.com/api/health
```
